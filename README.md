# Wildlife (WIP)

This project seeks to rework Minecraft's code
for passive mobs in order to achieve...
honestly, whatever I think fits.

Current aims are:
1. Increase animal availability to remove
   the need to keep farms.
   - Automatic breeding (done, may be reworked for 2)
2. Add new herd awareness
   1. Cohesion. This means animals within a herd
      (their spawn group) stay closer together.
      Avoid spreading out
   2. Herd Panic?
   3. Cyclic Herd paths?
        - Herds going to a water source
        - Herds going to fields
        - Yk, everything herds tend to do
   4. Herd merging? 
      Herds of the same type that meet join
      into one? TODO: Figure out conditions
